# A Collection of Mini Projects

This repository contains a set of small-scale projects that are too compact to justify their own repository.
They mainly serve as practice pieces to strengthen and showcase my analytical and data skills.
Each project focuses on a specific question or dataset and documents the workflow from data exploration to insights.

# Project: Hospital Bed and Case Analysis in Germany

**Folder:** hospital_beds_cases_analysis

This project analyzes the **relationship between hospital bed capacities and patient case numbers** in German hospital wards (data from 2019). The aim was to explore whether resources and workload are balanced across different specialties.

Steps of the Analysis include:
<ul>
    <li>Comparison of bed numbers and case numbers across multiple hospital wards in Germany</li>
    <li>Identification of wards with disproportionate capacities or workloads</li>
    <li>Application of the **Pareto principle** to focus on the top 10 wards covering 80% of all cases</li>
    <li>Visualizations of relationships (bar charts, scatterplots, cumulative distributions)</li>
    <li>Documentation and analysis written in **Quarto**, available in multiple languages (main language: German)</li>
</ul>
